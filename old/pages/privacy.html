            <h4><b>Privacy Policy</b></h4>
            <p>
              Jacob Allinson built "Sprout's Garden" as a free app under the Treetop Creative entity.
              This SERVICE is provided by Jacob Allinson at no cost and is intended for use as is.
              This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use,
              and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
              If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information
              in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and
              improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Information Collection and Use</b></h4>
            <p>
              Sprout's Garden does not collect any information from the user.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Log Data</b></h4>
            <p>
              Using my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data.
              This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version,
              the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Advertisements</b></h4>
            <p>
              This service is designed for children under the age of 13 but can be enjoyed by anyone.
              Ads are used to give players a reward when they are watched, thus the type of ads displayed
              is closely monitored by myself and Unity, the ad provider.
              An under 13 restriction is in place on all ads, meaning that inappropriate content will not be displayed.
              I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
              If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
              please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Contact Us</b></h4>

            <h4><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b></h4>
            <p>
              I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time.
              Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
